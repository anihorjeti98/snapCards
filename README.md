# snapCardsGame
Snap is a card game where two players split a deck and take turns flipping cards. If the card flipped matches the previous card, the first player to call “Snap” wins the pile. If a player makes a mistake and the cards do not match, the player commits a “False Snap” and the other player wins the pile. The game ends when one player loses all his cards. The other player wins the game. For this project I had to design the game model and identify and build the objects that I would need for the game, such as the individual cards, the deck, the players with their hand of cards and the pile of thrown cards, as well as the game engine itself.
